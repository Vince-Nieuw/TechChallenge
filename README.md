Setup AWS, first thing to do was IAM and create a secondary account.
Never use root for anything other than inial login. 
Generate API credentials for AWS CLI.  Generate AWS IAM account for Github access, disable console, challenge: no policy for EKS.
Gave full admin access (security risk, probs want to fix later //TODO)
