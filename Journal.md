Hello World!

#10 Feb 2025
Setup AWS, first thing to do was IAM and create a secondary account. Never use root for anything other than inial login. Generate API credentials for AWS CLI. Generate AWS IAM account for Github access, disable console, challenge: no policy for EKS. Gave full admin access (security risk, probs want to fix later //TODO)
20:41 - Restructured project and made a planning. Good to play around a bit, now lets get back in action.
